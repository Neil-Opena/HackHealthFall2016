# HackHealthFall2016
Zombie Apocalypse - a simple text based adventure - 
This program was created for my first Hackathon (HackHealth 2016, in Stony Brook University)

Prior to attending the Hackathon, the only experience I had with coding was when we wrote a "Hello World" program in my Introduction 
to Computers courses. I knew that it would be difficult, but I wanted to expose myself to the computer science community, since
I very much want to have a career in that field. 

My goal was to create a text-based game, like the old example of Zork. I used Python as the language and I used PyCharm to write
the code. In order to be actually successful, I used YouTube as a resource to teach me more complicated Python principles
that were not yet covered in my CS class. Examples such as function creation and if - else statements.

In the end, I won the first place prize to as the particpant that learned the most in the Hackathon.

I hope you enoy it!
